# Shopping Cart Web Application

## Overview
This project is a **fully functional shopping cart system** that allows users to **browse products, add items to the cart, view their cart, and proceed to checkout**. The cart preserves data using `localStorage`, ensuring that items remain saved even after a page refresh.

## Features
- 🛒 **Add products to cart** with images, names, and prices.
- 📌 **LocalStorage-based cart storage** (items persist after refresh).
- 📷 **Cart page displays product images alongside names and prices**.
- 🧹 **Remove individual items or clear the entire cart**.
- 💳 **Checkout page prompts billing details**, then displays only a confirmation message.
- 🔗 **Home button redirects users after order placement**.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/shopping-cart.git
   ```
2. Open the folder and launch `index.html` in a browser.
